This repository holds the project for Winter School 2023.

We divided the tasks among ourselves and were responsible for the correspondings Tasks 1, 2, 3. Throughout the project duration, we debugged each other's codes and algorithms so that we get an idea of each topic given to us.

The documentations for each task are uploaded in the same repository as a separate folder. Feel free to fork and run the python scripts.
